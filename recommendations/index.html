recommendations:
  - name: Breaking systems into modules
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/08/14/modularity.html
    review: |
      A good overview of how you can describe modules in terms of incoming/public/private dependencies, public abstraction and private implemantation.
      It argues that making the smallest possible modules isn't always desirable because then you increase complexity in the dependency graph between modules.
  - name: All advice comes from a context
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/19/all-advice-has-context.html
    review: |
      Taking rules to their logical extremes seldom leads to good code.
      The article brings up the problems with fads and how most advice doesn't apply 100% of the time.
      The question remains on how to teach junior programmers this, since it can take a lot of time to internalize very loose rules.
  - name: Data as a mediator between computation and state
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/08/28/using-data-to-mutate-state.html
    review: |
      Mutations can be described as actions (data) which can make systems easier to test, and can make it easier to introduce changes to cross-cutting concerns.
      
  - name: Deconstructing SOLID design principles
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2019/04/02/solid-critique.html
    review: |
      SOLID principles are mostly relevant on system boundaries, yet people advocate for using them everywhere.
  - name: Deconstructing the "Unix philosophy"
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/05/08/case-study-unix-philosophy.html
    review: |
      The article covers the advantages of "text as a universal interface" and the compasability of unix commands.
      It also brings up that the division of commands may make sense from a developer point of view,
      but interactive users are more task-oriented.
      They don't want to have to cobble together often non-reusable shell scripts for the kind of tasks they are interested in.
      It also contrasts "text as a universal interface" with "object as a universal interface" from PowerShell.
  - name: Design duality and the expression problem
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/02/27/the-expression-problem.html
    review: |
      APIs can be categorised based on if they guarantee extensibility through additional variants, operations or neither.
      Whatever extensibility category is promised disables adding internal changes in that category without breaking contracts.
      ADTs makes the fewest amount of guarantees and therefor enables the greatest internal flexibility if that is desired.
  - name: Epigrams in Programming
    link: https://cpsc.yale.edu/epigrams-programming
    review: |
      Some fun ideas to think about. My favourite is "A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing."
      It highlights that building extensible solutions in programming often involves disregarding runtime efficiency to a certain degree.
      A very static program can be written very efficiently, but it may not be easy to evolve it in the direction that stakeholders need it to without rewrites.
  - name: Patterns vs. Higher Order Functions
    link: https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jwalker/langDesign/OO_vs_Fun/notes.html
    review: |
      Patterns and higher-order functions are two concepts used to describe the same underlying concept in functional programming and object-oriented programming.
  - name: Parse, don't validate
    link: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/
    review: |
      Bake assumptions into your types to make invalid programs impossible to express.
      e.g. Rather than send a list around, and verifying that it contains at least one element as a pre-condition everwhere,
      create a at-least-one element list, and use it everywhere that needs the pre-condition.
  - name: Testing at the boundaries
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2019/03/19/testing-at-the-boundaries.html
    review: |
      The article brings up that when unit testing, it doesn't usually make sense to test every class in complete isolation.
      It is also critical of how the TDD concept has been warped over the years and that it started out as much more reasonable.
  - name: Testing, induction, and mocks
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/10/09/relationship-induction-and-tests.html
    review: |
      A critical critique of mocking and how it should be a last resort.
      Code should be structured to make mocking next to uneccessary in unit tests.
  - name: Types are the basic tool of software design
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/12/05/types-as-design-tool.html
    review: |
      Functions with a high-level of generality can sometimes make the implementation hard to write incorrectly,
      since an incorrect implementation would have to make assumptions that weren't part of the signature.
  - name: Designing Data-Intensive Applications
    link: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/
    review: |
      This book goes over a lot of different alternatives to storing and managing data, and discussing their trade-offs in large systems with high performance requirements.
  - name: "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"
    link: https://www.dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/
    review: |
      This book opened my eyes to how programming fits into organisations and their needs.
      Not as something alien to be cornered off from the organisation, but as something that should constantly be involved.
      It showed me that creativity and empathy can be really important for a programmer.

  - name: Effective Java
    link: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java/9780134686097/
    review: |
      A book that really highlightes that to get the most from a programming languages you need to consider its' features as part of greater whole.
      Some features are useful more often than others, and some have even become obsolete over time.
      Some patterns aren't explicit language features, but should be treated as if they were.
  - name: "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, Second Edition"
    link: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/extreme-programming-explained/0321278658/
    review: |
      This book gave me insight into how it is to truly work iteratively, and what a great concept that is.
      It helped me take one step at a time when coding, instead of attempting to make enourmous changes that were never really done and slow to test.
      It also opened my eyes to why we write user stories, and how important users really are.
  - name: Large-Scale C++ Software Design
    link: https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos/dp/0201633620
    review: |
      This book opened my eyes to how seemingly small design changes can reduce compile times for C++.
      It also taught me the importance of designing maintainable APIs.
  - name: Java Concurrency in Practice
    link: https://jcip.net/
    review: |
      A really great overview about the concurrency primitives available in Java.
      It also shows the advantages of using immutable data structures for concurrency
      instead of sharing mutable state.
  - name: Practical Object-Oriented Design, An Agile Primer Using Ruby
    link: https://www.poodr.com/
    review: |
      This book presents a good example of how to structure object-oriented code, and how to deal with testing in dynamic languages.
  - name: Programming in Lua 
    link: https://www.lua.org/pil/
    review: |
      My first introduction to a dynamic programming languages.
      I was moved by how effortlessly the author introduced concepts and built on top of those concepts without bringing up to much at the same time.
      It also got me to appreciate the implementation simplicity of Lua.
  - name: "Mythical Man-Month, The: Essays on Software Engineering"
    link: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mythical-man-month-the/0201835959/
    review: |
      A good historical piece of issues that plagued programming in 19th centuary, and that mostly still exists today but in a different shape.
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second system effect</a> still lead to tools today that bite off more than they can chew.
  - name: The Pragmatic Programmer
    link: https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/
    review: |
      A goodie bag of advice around software development that every software developer should read.
  - name: 99 Bottles of OOP
    link: https://sandimetz.com/99bottles
    review: |
      A great book focused around teaching object-oriented design, how it relates to TDD, and how it's better to duplicate code than use the wrong abstraction.
  - name: David Schmitz - 10 Tips for failing badly at Microservices
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8mtXJh3hzM
    review: |
      A funny presentation about how certain decisions can hurt more than others in preventing successuful adoption of microservices.
  - name: YOW! 2013 - The SOLID Design Principles Deconstructed
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMW08JkFrBA
    review: |
      The SOLID design principles as we know them aren't that useful.
      The author breaks them down and proposes alternatives.
  - name: Integrated Tests Are A Scam
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfX44fZoMc
    review: |
      A somewhat hyperbolic talk about how integration testing between systems often break, and should in many cases be replaced with contract testing.
  - name: CppCon 2014 - Data-Oriented Design and C++
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc
    review: |
      A very though-provoking presentation about data-oriented design and how it might be useful for high-performance application.
  - name: Ruby on Rails demo
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY
    review: |
      A revolutionary presentation at the time about convention-over-configuration and how to quickly develop seemingly simple applications such as CRUD and blogs.
  - name: "OOPSLA Conference: Growing a Language"
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw6TaiXzHAE
    review: |
      A presentation about how to develop the Java programming language in the future.
      It argues that an overly small language may not be that useful to many people.
  - name: Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4
    review: |
      A presentation about the history of object-oriented programming and functional programming and how they diverged.
  - name: Every Clojure Talk Ever
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlPaby7suOc
    review: |
      This is a pretty funny talk about hype-driven development in Clojure.
  - name: Building a psychologically safe workplace
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8
    review: |
      It's important that people feel safe that they can bring up issues.
      If not for moral reasons, then for the fact that otherwise people don't bring up problems.
      Those problems sometimes become really big, and we really want to solve them before that happens.
  - name: Programming is terrible — Lessons learned from a life wasted
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyL9EC0S0c
    review: |
      A cynical presentation about a lot of different programming aspects, mostly realted to social issues.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    I really like programming, and everything surrounding programming.

    I listen to youtube videos and read a lot of articles and books, and though that I could share those who have
    affected me the most and in what way.
