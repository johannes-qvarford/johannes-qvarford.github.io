recommendations:
  - name: Breaking systems into modules
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/08/14/modularity.html
    review: |
      A good overview of how you can describe modules in terms of incoming/public/private dependencies, public abstraction and private implemantation.
      It argues that making the smallest possible modules isn't always desirable because then you increase complexity in the dependency graph between modules.
  - name: All advice comes from a context
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/19/all-advice-has-context.html
    review: |
      Taking rules to their logical extremes seldom leads to good code.
      The article brings up the problems with fads and how most advice doesn't apply 100% of the time.
      The question remains on how to teach junior programmers this, since it can take a lot of time to internalize very loose rules.
  - name: Data as a mediator between computation and state
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/08/28/using-data-to-mutate-state.html
    review: |
      Mutations can be described as actions (data) which can make systems easier to test, and can make it easier to introduce changes to cross-cutting concerns.
      
  - name: Deconstructing SOLID design principles
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2019/04/02/solid-critique.html
    review: |
      SOLID principles are mostly relevant on system boundaries, yet people advocate for using them everywhere.
  - name: Deconstructing the "Unix philosophy"
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/05/08/case-study-unix-philosophy.html
    review: |
      The article covers the advantages of "text as a universal interface" and the compasability of unix commands.
      It also brings up that the division of commands may make sense from a developer point of view,
      but interactive users are more task-oriented.
      They don't want to have to cobble together often non-reusable shell scripts for the kind of tasks they are interested in.
      It also contrasts "text as a universal interface" with "object as a universal interface" from PowerShell.
  - name: Design duality and the expression problem
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/02/27/the-expression-problem.html
    review: |
      APIs can be categorised based on if they guarantee extensibility through additional variants, operations or neither.
      Whatever extensibility category is promised disables adding internal changes in that category without breaking contracts.
      ADTs makes the fewest amount of guarantees and therefor enables the greatest internal flexibility if that is desired.
  - name: Epigrams in Programming
    link: https://cpsc.yale.edu/epigrams-programming
    review: |
      Some fun ideas to think about. My favourite is "A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing."
      It highlights that building extensible solutions in programming often involves disregarding runtime efficiency to a certain degree.
      A very static program can be written very efficiently, but it may not be easy to evolve it in the direction that stakeholders need it to without rewrites.
  - name: Patterns vs. Higher Order Functions
    link: https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~jwalker/langDesign/OO_vs_Fun/notes.html
    review: |
      Patterns and higher-order functions are two concepts used to describe the same underlying concept in functional programming and object-oriented programming.
  - name: Parse, don't validate
    link: https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/
    review: |
      Bake assumptions into your types to make invalid programs impossible to express.
      e.g. Rather than send a list around, and verifying that it contains at least one element as a pre-condition everwhere,
      create a at-least-one element list, and use it everywhere that needs the pre-condition.
  - name: Testing at the boundaries
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2019/03/19/testing-at-the-boundaries.html
    review: |
      The article brings up that when unit testing, it doesn't usually make sense to test every class in complete isolation.
      It is also critical of how the TDD concept has been warped over the years and that it started out as much more reasonable.
  - name: Testing, induction, and mocks
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/10/09/relationship-induction-and-tests.html
    review: |
      A critical critique of mocking and how it should be a last resort.
      Code should be structured to make mocking next to uneccessary in unit tests.
  - name: Types are the basic tool of software design
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/12/05/types-as-design-tool.html
    review: |
      Functions with a high-level of generality can sometimes make the implementation hard to write incorrectly,
      since an incorrect implementation would have to make assumptions that weren't part of the signature.
  - name: Designing Data-Intensive Applications
    link: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/
    review: |
      This book goes over a lot of different alternatives to storing and managing data, and discussing their trade-offs in large systems with high performance requirements.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    I really like programming, and everything surrounding programming.

    I listen to youtube videos and read a lot of articles and books, and though that I could share those who have
    affected me the most and in what way.


    <h3>List</h3>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        {% for rec in page.recommendations %}
        {% include rec.md name=rec.name link=rec.link review=rec.review %}
