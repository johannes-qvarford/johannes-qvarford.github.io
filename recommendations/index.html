recommendations:
  - name: Breaking systems into modules
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/08/14/modularity.html
    review: |
      A good overview of how you can describe modules in terms of incoming/public/private dependencies, public abstraction and private implemantation.
      It argues that making the smallest possible modules isn't always desirable because then you increase complexity in the dependency graph between modules.
  - name: All advice comes from a context
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/19/all-advice-has-context.html
    review: |
      Taking rules to their logical extremes seldom leads to good code.
      The article brings up the problems with fads and how most advice doesn't apply 100% of the time.
      The question remains on how to teach junior programmers this, since it can take a lot of time to internalize very loose rules.
  - name: Data as a mediator between computation and state
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/08/28/using-data-to-mutate-state.html
    review: |
      Mutations can be described as actions (data) which can make systems easier to test, and can make it easier to introduce changes to cross-cutting concerns.
      
  - name: Deconstructing SOLID design principles
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2019/04/02/solid-critique.html
    review: |
      SOLID principles are mostly relevant on system boundaries, yet people advocate for using them everywhere.
  - name: Deconstructing the "Unix philosophy"
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/05/08/case-study-unix-philosophy.html
    review: |
      The article covers the advantages of "text as a universal interface" and the compasability of unix commands.
      It also brings up that the division of commands may make sense from a developer point of view,
      but interactive users are more task-oriented.
      They don't want to have to cobble together often non-reusable shell scripts for the kind of tasks they are interested in.
      It also contrasts "text as a universal interface" with "object as a universal interface" from PowerShell.
  - name: Design duality and the expression problem
    link: https://www.tedinski.com/2018/02/27/the-expression-problem.html
    review: |
      APIs can be categorised based on if they guarantee extensibility through additional variants, operations or neither.
      Whatever extensibility category is promised disables adding internal changes in that category without breaking contracts.
      ADTs makes the fewest amount of guarantees and therefor enables the greatest internal flexibility if that is desired.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    I really like programming, and everything surrounding programming.

    I listen to youtube videos and read a lot of articles and books, and though that I could share those who have
    affected me the most and in what way.


    <h3>List</h3>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        {% for rec in page.recommendations %}
        {% include rec.md name=rec.name link=rec.link review=rec.review %}
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
