Ever since I was a child, I've wanted to program computer applications.
When one of my video games stopped working, I swore that when I grew up, I would contribute to making good software.

I first started writing code in junior high. Back then, I was making ROM hacks of Super Mario World. 
I quickly realized that the level editor was very limiting, so I started learning assembly for the SNES to program new enemies.
I released demo versions for two rom hacks: Super Mario World: Kaizo Returns and Waluigi's Treasure Hunt.

Feel free to download the <a href="/assets/waluigis-treasure-hunt.ips">patch for Waluigi's Treasure Hunt</a>.
In order to play through it, you need a legal copy of a Super Mario World ROM and an SNES emulator like ZSNES.

There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18DB9F871D181135">playthrough of New Super Mario World: Kaizo Returns</a> by AuthenticZac available online.
